# Crowdsale PupperCoin
The following repository is to show the skills and understanding of creating a crowsale contract to autmatically mint coins using Solidity from the lectures taught by the Rice University FinTech Bootcamp and 2U.[1]

## General Information

A company has decided to crowdsale their PupperCoin token in order to help fund the network development.
This network will be used to track the dog breeding activity across the globe in a decentralized way, and allow humans to track the genetic trail of their pets. The necessary legal bodies have been worked with and the green light on creating a crowdsale open to the public has been given. However, refunds are required to be given if the crowdsale is successful and the goal is met.  A maximum of 300 Ether is only allowed to be raised. The crowdsale will run for 24 weeks.[1]

ERC20 token that will be minted through a Crowdsale contract leveraged from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

This crowdsale contract will manage the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).

This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.
It will need to inherit Crowdsale, CappedCrowdsale, TimedCrowdsale, RefundableCrowdsale, and MintedCrowdsale.
The crowdsale contract will use the Kovan testnet in order to get a real-world pre-production test in.[1]
